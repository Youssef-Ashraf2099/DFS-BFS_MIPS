# DFS-BFS_MIPS
creating the DFS and BFS using MIPS
This project was done in my second semester and the goal is convert the array which is actually word in mips into a tree and then calling depth-first search and breadth-first search methods in the array which is converted into tree to search for all of the element if it is breadth-first search or searching the last nodes leafs in the depth-first search
